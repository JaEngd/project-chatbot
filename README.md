Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
We have created a chat bot who gives you random compliments. 

## The problem
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

we have had different problems one of them was to stop the page from reloding after the first user msg. Another was to trigger next msg after answering yes or no question. We got a lot of help by reading and asking questions on stackoverflow. 
we found the lokation.relode funktion and return false to make the page relode after chosing the no button. 
We also found the random funktion that we added to our bot by adding tha math floor and math random funktion.
